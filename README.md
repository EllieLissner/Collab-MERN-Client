### Technologies Used
    Database Structure:
        Mongo/Mongoose
    Server:
        Express
    Front-end Language:
        React.js
    Back-end Language:

### Installation

    Fork and clone this repo

    run npm i to install dependencies

    .env.local will require a connection to your separate server repo 

    You will need an API key from [Open Weather] (https://openweathermap.org/api)

## Approach

    The goal was to make a calendar with easy sharing functionality with the daily itinerary available at a 
    glance. The easiest way to make this work was with a functioning calendar component that pulls and renders events for the day in a handy list. We also have sharing functionality built right into the add event tab, and you can view those shared events right on your landing page. 

    React was uniquely suited to this challenge with its component based framework. We were able to leverage this functionality to send the daily itinerary to multiple views to keep the viewer organized. Also, any kind of calendar will benefit from being broken into several parts to reduce the lines of code within any one file and also greatly improves organization. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
